# NeSy-Code-Generation-Workflow
A neuro-symbolic workflow for generating controlled synthetic data for a code comment dataset

This is the official code repository for the paper: ["NeSy is alive and well: A LLM-driven symbolic approach for better code comment data generation and classification
"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16910).

## data
This directory contains three data files:
- **Seed data:** The data provided by the IRSE 2023 shared task organizers to train the ML models.
- **ChatGPT-generated data:** The data generated by a LLM assistant (ChatGPT in this case) to evaluate the overall increase in model performance after data augmentation.
- **Symbolic-generated data:** The data generated by a script created by ChatGPT by learning symbolic rules to evaluate the overall increase in model performance after data augmentation.

## experiments
This directory contains the code for training and evaluating ML models on all datasets. The code also contains data augmentation techniques using synthetic data.

## src
This directory contains the source material such as the symbolic rules framework and the symbolic script for synthetic data generation.
